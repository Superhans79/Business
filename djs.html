							<h2>Marshall</h2>
							<p>Marshall started DJing back in 1989, inspired by the likes of Graeme Park and Mick Pickering at the Hacienda, and the amazing new music he was hearing around that time. He played at some of the very early nights in Leeds, before starting his first residency at the legendary Warehouse club. Here he played with DJ Ease and Boy Wonder (Nightmares on Wax) taking the last two hours to a packed club every week. This is where he learnt his craft as a DJ.</p>
                            <p>Soon after this he was doing guest spots at some of the biggest club nights in the country, going onto
play at the club that started it all for him; The Hacienda. Playing at the club’s 11th birthday alongside
Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Tony Humphries, Sasha and, of course, Graeme and Mike is a
really special memory for Marshall. He went on to play at the Hacienda many more times over the
years.</p>
                            <p>By the early 90s he had a new residency at Up Yer Ronson. The night went on to be huge, with
people coming from all over the UK to party in Leeds on a Friday night, along with the spectacular
Soak nights at the Corn Exchange. Playing for Up Yer Ronson also took Marshall to Ibiza to play at
Amnesia, Es Paradise, Privilege and Space Terrace the very first year it opened. He continued to play all around the UK throughout the 90s, releasing three songs with the Up Yer
Ronson Band, enjoying success in the UK Charts. Present day, he still plays regularly at the New Up Yer Ronson and Soak nights in Leeds, as well as
various nights around the UK.</p>

He held the residency for six fun filled years of madness &amp; wicked parties. </p>

							<h2>Good2Groove</h2>
							<p>Successful DJs in their own right, Wayne and Scott formed Good2Groove in 2012; united by a passion for live, authentic music and an unapologetic love for vinyl. Sampling is the pair’s trademark, with most of their sets incorporating a veritable feast of acappellas and live drums, combined with deep, soulful house and disco tracks. And, a few edits thrown in for good measure. </p>
                            <p>Their individual styles, combined with their trademark breaks, make the duo a force to be reckoned with. This, and their love for playing long warm-up sets, is probably the reason they’ve been invited to play on some huge nights, both up North and overseas. Over the past 20 years the DJs have had the opportunity to play alongside the likes of, Joey Negro, Graeme Park, Ron Carroll, Alistair Whitehead, Cj Mackintosh, Tom Wainwright, E Smoove, K Klass, Soul Avengerz, Brandon Block, Bobby & Steve, Jim Shaft Ryan, Lenny Fontana, Terry Farley, Marshall Jefferson and Fanatix; the list goes on. </p>
                            <p>The duo’s epic backlog gives them all the right credentials, proven by their fortnightly radio show ‘Sneaky Disco’, on Boogie Bunker Radio. With up to 5,000 hits on each EP, featuring guest DJs from around the world, the show has really put Good2Groove on the map. The support they’ve received from club masters Louie Vega and Frankie Knuckles, right through to Disco DJs such as Dr Packer, is testament to the pair’s dedication, fuelling the show’s fire for over three years.</p>
