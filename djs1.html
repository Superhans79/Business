							<h2>Marshall</h2>
							<p>Marshall started DJing back in 1989, inspired by the likes of Graeme Park and Mick Pickering at the Hacienda, and the amazing new music he was hearing around that time. He did some of the very early nights in Leeds, before starting his first residency at the legendary Warehouse club. Here he played with DJ Ease and Boy Wonder (Nightmares on Wax) taking the last two hours to a packed club every week. This is where he learnt his craft as a DJ..</p>
                            <p>Soon after he was doing guest spots at some of the biggest club nights in the country, going onto
play at the club that started it all for him; The Hacienda. Playing at the club’s 11th birthday alongside
Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Tony Humphries, Sasha, and of course Graeme and Mike is a
really special memory for Marshall. He went on to play at the Hacienda many more times over the
years.</p>
                            <p>By the early 90s he had a new residency at Up Yer Ronson. The night went on to be huge, with
people coming from all over the UK to party in Leeds on a Friday night, along with the spectacular
Soak nights at the Corn Exchange. Playing for Up Yer Ronson also took him to Ibiza to play at
Amnesia, Es Paradise, Privilege, and Space Terrace the very first year it opened.</p>
                            <p>He continued to play all around the UK throughout the 90s, releasing three songs with the Up Yer
Ronson Band, enjoying success in the UK Charts.</p>
                            <p>Present day, he still plays regularly at the New Up Yer Ronson and Soak nights in Leeds, as well as
various nights around the UK.</p>

							<h2>Good2Groove</h2>
							<p>Wayne &amp; Gilly formed Good2Groove back in 2012. Both DJ's in their own right but both wanted to bring a bit more of a live element to their style of play. Sampling tracks or live drums with acapellas incorporated into their sets is something they love to do. Both have a massive love of deep &amp; soulful house but also a passion for disco house and edits. Each bringing their own style to Good2Groove has kept them in touch, and with their infectious style of sets, they always seem to deliver. Good2Groove's love of playing long warm-up sets and being selfless is one of the reasons they got asked to play on some huge northern house music nights as well as getting opportunities to play overseas.  We have both been lucky enough over the last 20yrs to play alongside the likes of,
Joey Negro, Graeme Park, Ron Carroll, Alistair Whitehead, Cj Mackintosh, Tom Wainwright, Al Mckensie, E Smoove, K Klass, Soul Avengerz, Brandon Block, Bobby &amp; Steve, Superkings, Buckley, Inland Knights, Dj Disciple, King Unique, Jazzy M, Richard Earnshaw, Smoking Jo, Jim Shaft Ryan, Lenny Fontana, Terry Farley, Marshall Jefferson, Fanatix, to name just a few.</p>
                            <p>Having a fortnightly radio show on Boogie Bunker Radio called Sneaky Disco has really made Good2groove stand out on their own with their selection of disco &amp; House. Fortnightly guests from around the world have really put Wayne &amp; Scott into a different league when it comes to getting an artist involved with what they do. Support from Louie Vega, Frankie Knuckles, Victor Simonelli, Silver Rider, Yam Who, Lenny Fontana, Full Intention, Pontchartrain, Ash Reynolds,Derek Kaye, Natasha Kitty Katt &amp; Get Down Edits are just a very small number of guests that have provided guest mix on their show which has been going for other 3yrs.</p>
                            <p>Having launched their night TheGet Up last year, it's now starting to really evolve into a really classy affair. Getting to play what you love with friends and partners in TheGet Up is something really special and we love it. Long may it continue. </p>
